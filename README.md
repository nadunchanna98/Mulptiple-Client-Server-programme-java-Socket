# Multiple-Client-Server-java-Socket-programme

Concurrency and network clients

• one server
• multiple clients
• error handling

• A client program creates a socket on its end of the communication,
and attempts to connect that socket to a server.

• When the connection is made the server,
creates a socket object on its end of the communication.

• The client and the server can now 
communicate by writing to and reading from the socket.
